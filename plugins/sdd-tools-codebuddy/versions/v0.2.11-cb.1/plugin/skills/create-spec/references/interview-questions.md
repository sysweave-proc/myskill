## Adaptive Question Strategies

### When User Says "No Preference"
- Skip related technical detail questions
- Focus on functional requirements instead
- Note that technical decisions will be made during implementation

### When User Indicates Area is Important
- Probe deeper with follow-up questions
- Ask for specific examples
- Request quantitative requirements where applicable

### When User is Unsure
- Offer common options/patterns as examples
- Suggest industry best practices via the recommendation system
- Consider proactive research for compliance or complex topics
- Mark as open question to resolve later if user defers decision

**Connecting to Recommendations:**

When a user expresses uncertainty, this is an opportunity to offer proactive recommendations:

1. **Trigger phrases**: "I'm not sure", "what do you recommend?", "what's standard?", "what do others do?"
2. **Response approach**:
   - Offer a brief best-practice recommendation as an inline insight
   - If the topic is complex (compliance, architecture), consider proactive research
   - Present options using `AskUserQuestion` with clear trade-offs
3. **Example flow**:
   ```
   User: "I'm not sure what authentication approach to use"

   Agent: [Detects auth trigger + uncertainty]
   Agent: [Offers inline insight via AskUserQuestion]
   "For public-facing apps, OAuth 2.0 with PKCE is the recommended approach.
    Would you like to include this in the spec?"
   Options: Include this | Tell me more | Skip
   ```

**See also:** `recommendation-triggers.md` for trigger patterns and `recommendation-format.md` for presentation templates.

### When Building Feature for Existing Product
- Codebase exploration is offered before Round 1 (see "Codebase Exploration" in main SKILL.md)
- If deep team analysis was performed, use the synthesized findings to:
  - Reference specific patterns and conventions found (with file paths)
  - Confirm integration points identified during exploration rather than asking open-ended questions
  - Skip tech stack and architecture questions already answered by exploration
  - Ask about trade-offs for challenges identified (e.g., coupling, performance concerns)
- If quick exploration was performed, use findings for targeted follow-ups
- If exploration was skipped, ask about existing patterns, integration points, and codebase conventions directly

### Soft Ceiling

Expanded interviews have a soft ceiling of **~8 rounds** or **~35 questions**, whichever is reached first.

After hitting the soft ceiling:
1. Evaluate coverage across all four question categories
2. If critical gaps remain (e.g., no security requirements for a compliance project), continue for up to **2 more rounds**
3. If coverage is adequate, proceed to the Recommendations Round (Phase 4)
