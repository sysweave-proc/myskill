## Detection Guidelines

### When to Offer Inline Insights

Offer brief insights during rounds when:
1. A trigger keyword is detected
2. The topic is relevant to the current question context
3. Maximum 2 inline insights per round to avoid overwhelm

### When to Save for Recommendations Round

Save for the dedicated recommendations round when:
1. Multiple related triggers are detected
2. The recommendation requires more context to present
3. Research might strengthen the recommendation
4. The topic needs user decision (e.g., choosing between approaches)

### When to Trigger Proactive Research

Automatically research (without explicit user request) when:
1. Compliance topics are mentioned (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI, WCAG)
2. User expresses uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "what do you recommend?")
3. Complex technical trade-offs need current information
4. Maximum 2 proactive research calls per interview

## Trigger Tracking

During the interview, track detected triggers:

```
Detected Triggers:
- [x] Authentication (Round 1) - OAuth 2.0 recommended
- [x] Scale (Round 2) - Caching strategy recommended
- [ ] Security (Round 2) - Pending recommendation
- [x] Real-time (Round 3) - WebSocket vs SSE presented

Proactive Research Used: 1/2
- GDPR compliance requirements (Round 2)
```

This tracking informs the Recommendations Round content.
