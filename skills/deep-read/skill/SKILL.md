name: deep-read
description: Comprehensive codebase reading engine. Systematically reads actual source code line by line through a 6-phase protocol — scoping, structural mapping, execution tracing, deep reading, pattern synthesis, and structured reporting. Source code is the source of truth. Use when needing to truly understand how code works, not just what documentation claims. 中文触发（用户这样说时使用）：深读这段源码、逐行读代码、这个函数到底在做什么、追一条真实调用链、搞清楚某个机制怎么实现、这条执行流的走向、这个数据结构怎么变化、验证某结论在源码里是否成立、回源码核对。定位是源码事实获取与深层推理，每条结论都要落到具体文件与行号。

# Deep Read — Codebase Reading Engine

Systematic source-code-first analysis protocol. Reads implementations, not just interfaces. Every finding cites `file:line`.

**Core principle:** Source code is the source of truth. Documentation lies, comments rot, function names mislead. Read the actual code. A code graph or index (LSP, a code-graph tool) speeds up *locating* code but is itself a possibly-stale snapshot — never ground truth. Verify every graph- or LSP-derived hit against live source before citing it.

## Protocol

Process every `/deep-read` invocation through these 6 phases in strict order. Never skip a phase. Gate each phase: do not advance until the gate condition is met.

---

### Phase 1: SCOPE — Define the Reading Target

Narrow the target to a tractable area before reading anything.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as the reading target (module, flow, question, or path)
2. Read CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for project context — but treat these as **hints, not truth**
3. Run initial discovery to estimate scope:
   - `Glob` for relevant file patterns (`**/*.ts`, `**/*.py`, etc.)
   - `Grep` for key terms from the target description
   - Count matching files
4. If scope exceeds 50 source files, narrow **deterministically** — this skill runs forked and cannot ask the user (see Fork note):
   - Rank candidates by centrality (import fan-in within the candidate set), tie-broken by recency (`git log -1 --format=%ct -- <file>`)
   - Keep the top 49 and drop the rest (the Phase-1 gate below is strict: under 50) — never sample arbitrarily, and never widen the gate to fit the target
   - Record the cap (total candidates, how many kept, the ranking key) in the scope definition and restate it in the report as an explicit coverage limit
   - If the kept set still spans unrelated subsystems, the target is too broad to read coherently: say so in the report and name the narrower sub-targets a follow-up `/deep-read` should take, rather than presenting an arbitrary slice as if it were the whole
5. If the target is a **question** (e.g., "how are commissions calculated?"):
   - Translate to concrete search terms
   - Grep for domain terms to locate relevant modules
6. If the target is a **path** (e.g., `src/services/billing/`):
   - List all files in the path
   - Identify entry points (exported functions, route handlers, main files)

**Output:** A scope definition listing:
- Target description (1-2 sentences)
- File list (< 50 source files)
- Applied narrowing cap, if any (total candidates → kept, ranking key)
- Identified entry points
- Out-of-scope areas (explicitly noted)

**Gate:** Scope is defined and contains < 50 source files. Entry points identified. Proceed.

---

### Phase 2: MAP — Build Structural Overview

Understand the shape of the code before reading it deeply.

1. **Directory structure** — map the relevant directories:
   - Use `Glob` to list files by type and directory
   - Note the organizational pattern (by feature, by layer, by domain)
2. **Tech stack** — identify from configs (not from docs):
   - Read `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent
   - Note frameworks, key dependencies, build tools
3. **Entry points** — verify by reading actual files (not just file names):
   - Read route definitions, main files, exported modules
   - Read the first 50 lines of each candidate entry point
   - Confirm which files are actual entry points vs. helpers
4. **Dependency graph** — map internal imports within the scope:
   - Grep for import/require statements within scoped files
   - Build a mental model: what calls what, what depends on what
   - Identify the **core files** (most imported by others)
   - When the code-graph heuristic (see Tool Usage below) holds, an indexed code-graph query (or LSP workspace symbols) returns module structure + centrality in one pass — faster than grepping imports and spanning languages per-language tooling silos; confirm the ranking against source before trusting it
5. **Configuration and constants** — read files that define behavior:
   - Config files, environment schemas, constants, enums, types
   - These shape behavior as much as code does

For 20+ file scopes, run steps 2-4 **sequentially in-fork** — batch each step's independent `Glob`/`Grep`/`Read` calls into a single message so they execute in parallel (see Fork note).

**Output:** Structural map including:
- Directory layout with annotations
- Tech stack (from configs, not docs)
- Entry points (verified by reading)
- Dependency flow diagram (text-based)
- Core files ranked by centrality

**Gate:** Entry points verified by reading actual files. Dependency flow mapped. Proceed.

---

### Phase 3: TRACE — Follow Execution Paths

Start from entry points and trace through the code. Read every file in the path.

1. **Select the primary execution path** based on the reading target:
   - For a flow (e.g., "payment processing"): start at the user-facing entry point
   - For a module: start at its public API / exports
   - For a question: start at the code most likely to contain the answer
2. **Trace forward** from the entry point:
   - Read the entry point file **in full** with the Read tool
   - For every function call, class instantiation, or module import encountered:
     - Locate the implementation: LSP `goToDefinition`/`outgoingCalls` for a precise one-hop jump, or Grep as fallback; for a whole-repo transitive or cross-language chain that one-hop, per-language LSP cannot follow, query a code graph — but only when the two-gate heuristic under Tool Usage holds (a targeted single-symbol trace, even across languages, stays on LSP/Grep)
     - Grep to locate the implementation (not just the type signature)
     - Read the implementation file in full — a graph/LSP edge only points to the file; the gate still requires reading it
   - Continue until reaching terminal operations (DB queries, API calls, file I/O, return values)
3. **Document the path** as a chain with `file:line` citations:
   ```
   Request enters at routes/payments.ts:42 (POST /api/payments)
     -> calls PaymentService.processPayment() at services/payment.ts:87
       -> validates input via PaymentSchema at schemas/payment.ts:15
       -> calls StripeClient.charge() at clients/stripe.ts:34
         -> constructs request at clients/stripe.ts:45-62
       -> stores result via PaymentRepository.save() at repos/payment.ts:28
     -> returns PaymentResponse at routes/payments.ts:58
   ```
4. **Trace secondary paths** if the reading target involves multiple flows:
   - Error paths, edge cases, fallback logic
   - Event handlers, webhooks, background jobs triggered by the primary path
5. **Note every branch point** — conditions, switches, feature flags:
   - What determines which path is taken?
   - Read the condition logic, don't just note "there's a conditional here"

**Output:** Complete execution trace(s) with `file:line` citations for every step.

**Gate:** At least 1 complete path traced from entry to terminal. Every file in the path has been Read in full. Proceed.

---

### Phase 4: DEEP READ — Line-by-Line Analysis of Critical Files

This is the core phase. Read critical files thoroughly, understanding every line of business logic.

1. **Identify critical files** from Phase 3 — files that contain:
   - Business logic (calculations, rules, transformations)
   - State management (mutations, transactions, side effects)
   - Security logic (auth, validation, access control)
   - Data transformations (mapping, filtering, aggregation)
   - Error handling (catch blocks, error boundaries, recovery logic)
2. **Read each critical file in full** with the Read tool:
   - Do NOT skim — read the entire file
   - For files > 500 lines: read in sections, but read ALL sections
   - Launch parallel Read calls for independent files
3. **For each critical file, document:**
   - **Purpose:** What this file actually does (based on code, not comments)
   - **Key functions:** Each function's logic, with citations:
     ```
     calculateCommission(sale: Sale): number  [billing/commission.ts:45-78]
       - Base rate: 5% of sale.amount (line 52)
       - Bonus tier: if sale.amount > 10000, rate += 2% (line 56)
       - Cap: commission capped at 5000 (line 62)
       - Proration: multiplied by daysInPeriod/30 (line 67)
       - Returns: rounded to 2 decimal places (line 74)
     ```
   - **Formulas and conditions:** Write out the actual math and logic, not summaries
   - **State changes:** What gets mutated, what side effects occur
   - **Edge cases handled:** Null checks, bounds, error recovery
   - **Edge cases NOT handled:** Missing validation, unchecked assumptions
4. **Cross-reference between files:**
   - When file A calls file B, verify that A's expectations match B's implementation
   - Note any mismatches between interface contracts and implementations
   - Check that error handling in callers matches errors thrown by callees

**Output:** Detailed analysis of each critical file with:
- Function-level logic documentation with `file:line` citations
- Formulas written out explicitly
- Conditions and branch logic documented
- State changes and side effects listed

**Gate:** Every critical file (identified in step 1) has been Read in full. Logic documented with formulas, conditions, and citations. Proceed.

### Phase 5: CONNECT — Synthesize Understanding

Step back and reason about the system as a whole. Use sequential-thinking MCP for structured analysis.

1. **Start a sequential-thinking chain** with all evidence from Phases 1-4:
   ```javascript
   mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
     thought: "Synthesizing understanding of <target>. Evidence from phases: ...",
     thoughtNumber: 1,
     totalThoughts: 8,
     nextThoughtNeeded: true
   })
   ```
2. **Identify patterns** across the codebase (minimum 3):
   - Architectural patterns (layering, dependency injection, event-driven, etc.)
   - Coding conventions (error handling style, naming patterns, data flow patterns)
   - Implicit rules (invariants maintained by convention, not enforced by code)
   - Anti-patterns or technical debt
   - Aggregate structural leads — dead code, all implementers of an interface, dependency cycles, fan-in/out hotspots — surface from a code graph if one is indexed; feed them into the synthesis but promote none to a finding until confirmed in live source with a `file:line` citation
3. **Map data flows** end to end:
   - How does data enter the system?
   - What transformations does it undergo? (with `file:line` citations)
   - Where does it end up? (DB, API response, file, event)
4. **Identify risks and assumptions:**
   - What assumptions does the code make that aren't validated?
   - What would break if those assumptions were violated?
   - Are there race conditions, consistency gaps, or security concerns?
5. **Answer the original question** if the reading target was a question:
   - Provide the answer with full evidence chain
   - Cite every source

Use **branching** in sequential-thinking to explore alternative interpretations of ambiguous code.

**Output:** Synthesis including:
- 3+ patterns identified with evidence (`file:line`)
- End-to-end data flow map
- Risk assessment
- Answer to the original question (if applicable)

**Gate:** At least 5 reasoning steps completed. At least 3 patterns identified with `file:line` evidence. Proceed.

---

### Phase 6: REPORT — Structured Deliverable

Produce the final report. Every claim must cite `file:line`.

```markdown
## Deep Read Report: <target>

### Scope
- **Target:** <what was analyzed>
- **Files analyzed:** <count> files, <count> read in full
- **Coverage limit:** <none, or: top <N> of <total> candidates by <ranking key>; remainder out of scope>

## Tool Usage by Phase

| Phase | Primary Tools | Parallelism & Escalation (in-fork) |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1. SCOPE | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash (`git log`, for recency ranking) | -- |
| 2. MAP | Glob, Grep, Read (configs, entry points), LSP / code graph (structure, centrality) | Batch steps 2-4 lookups into one message (20+ files) |
| 3. TRACE | Read (full files), Grep (cross-refs), LSP call hierarchy, code graph (whole-repo transitive / aggregate — see heuristic) | Batch independent Grep / LSP lookups |
| 4. DEEP READ | Read (full files, parallel) | -- |
| 5. CONNECT | sequential-thinking MCP, code graph (aggregate / dead-code queries) | deep-analysis skill for complex reasoning |
| 6. REPORT | Structured output | -- |

> **Fork note:** `/deep-read` runs forked (`context: fork`) for context isolation — the full-file reads and traces stay out of the main conversation and only the report returns. Forked subagents cannot use the `Agent` launcher or `AskUserQuestion`, so this protocol is written to need neither: every phase runs on Primary Tools (Read/Glob/Grep/Bash/LSP/sequential-thinking), Phase 1 narrows deterministically instead of asking, and "parallel" throughout means batching independent tool calls into one message — never spawning agents. Anything that genuinely needs the user's choice is surfaced as an open question in the report rather than asked mid-run.

**Code-graph accelerator (optional, tool-agnostic).** A per-repo indexed code graph earns its one-time setup ONLY when BOTH gates hold: (1) the repo is large (hundreds+ of files) or spans multiple languages, AND (2) the question is whole-repo-transitive or aggregate (full blast-radius, broad refactor, dead-code, "all implementers of X", architecture overview). One gate alone is not enough — a targeted trace, even across languages, or an aggregate question on a small single-language repo, stays on LSP/Grep/Read. Otherwise LSP (always-available, one-hop, never stale) + Grep + Read are faster. Query an existing index directly; if none exists and both gates hold, recommend building one in the report rather than bootstrapping it silently. Any code-graph tool works — e.g. CodeGraphContext / `cgc`, opt-in and per-repo, not shipped or registered by this framework (see the tool's own docs to install).

## Anti-Patterns — What This Skill Prevents

| Bad Habit | What `/deep-read` Does Instead |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Read README/CLAUDE.md and call it done | Phase 1 treats docs as hints; Phases 3-4 read source |
| Skim file headers and imports only | Phase 4 requires line-by-line reading with citations |
| Summarize without evidence | Every claim must cite `file:line` |
| Stop at the first abstraction layer | Phase 3 traces full call chains to leaf functions |
| Rely on function names to infer behavior | Phase 4 reads implementations, documents actual logic |
| Produce vague "this seems to do X" | Phase 4 requires concrete formulas and conditions |
| Read types/interfaces instead of implementations | Phase 3 Greps for implementations, not just signatures |
| Trust a graph/index query as truth | Graphs and LSP are stale-able snapshots; every hit is confirmed in live source before citing (`file:line`) |
| Skip error paths and edge cases | Phase 3 traces secondary paths; Phase 4 documents edge cases |

## Scope Examples

```
/deep-read payment processing flow from checkout to settlement
/deep-read src/services/billing/
/deep-read how are sales commissions calculated and distributed?
/deep-read the authentication and authorization system
/deep-read data pipeline from ingestion to reporting dashboard
/deep-read how does the caching layer work and when does it invalidate?
```

## When to Use `/deep-read` vs Other Tools

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Understand how existing code works | `/deep-read` |
| Quick "what does this function do?" | Read tool directly |
| Bug, crash, error, unexpected behavior | `/investigate` |
| Architecture decision or trade-off | `/deep-analysis` |
| Explore open options before deciding ("what are our options?") | `/diverge` |
| Build a new feature | `/execute` |
| Understand code, then reason about it | `/deep-read` then `/deep-analysis` |
| Understand code, then redesign it | `/deep-read` then `/deep-analysis` then `/execute` |
| Onboard to an unfamiliar codebase | `/deep-read` |
| Code review with full context | `/deep-read` then code-quality agent |
