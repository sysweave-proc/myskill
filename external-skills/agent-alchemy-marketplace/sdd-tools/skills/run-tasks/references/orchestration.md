# Orchestration Reference

This reference provides the detailed 7-step orchestration loop for the run-tasks skill. The orchestrator runs Steps 1-3 (planning) and Step 3's confirmation in the user's conversation context. Steps 4-7 (execution, summary, finalize) are covered in the execution section of this reference.

---

## Step 1: Load & Validate

```
Input:  TaskList + CLI args (--task-group, --phase)
Output: Filtered, validated task set
Exit:   If no tasks match filters, all completed, or no unblocked tasks
```

### 1a: Read TaskList

Use `TaskList` to retrieve all tasks and their current state (status, blockedBy, metadata).

### 1b: Apply Filters

Apply filters in order. When both `--task-group` and `--phase` are provided, both apply (intersection).

**Task Group Filter** (`--task-group`):

If `--task-group` was provided, filter the task list to only tasks where `metadata.task_group` matches the specified group name (exact match, case-sensitive).

If no tasks match the group:
```
No tasks found for group '{name}'. Available groups: {sorted distinct task_group values}.
```
Stop execution.

**Phase Filter** (`--phase`):

If `--phase` was provided (one or more comma-separated positive integers):

1. Parse the `--phase` value into a list of integers. If any value is not a positive integer, report:
   ```
   Invalid --phase value: must be comma-separated positive integers (e.g., --phase 1,2).
   ```
   Stop execution.

2. Filter the task list to only tasks where `metadata.spec_phase` matches one of the specified phase numbers.

3. Tasks without `spec_phase` metadata are **excluded** when `--phase` is active — they cannot match any phase number.

4. If no tasks match the phase filter:
   ```
   No tasks found for phase(s) {N}. Available phases: {sorted distinct spec_phase values from all tasks}.
   ```
   Stop execution.

### 1c: Validate Task Set

**Single-task mode** (`<task-id>` positional argument):

If a task ID was provided as a positional argument:

1. Look up the task by ID via `TaskList`. If no task matches the ID:
   ```
   Task #{id} not found. Use TaskList to see available tasks.
   ```
   Stop execution.

2. If the task is already `completed`:
   ```
   Task #{id} '{subject}' is already completed.
   ```
   Stop execution.

3. If the task has unmet dependencies (blockedBy tasks that are not completed), warn but allow execution:
   ```
   Warning: Task #{id} has unmet dependencies: [{blocker_ids}]. Proceeding anyway (single-task mode).
   ```

4. Set the filtered task set to just this single task and continue to Step 2.

After filtering, validate the resulting task set against these edge cases in order:

**Empty task list** (no tasks at all, before or after filtering):
```
No tasks found. Use /create-tasks to generate tasks from a spec, or create tasks manually.
```
Stop execution.

**All tasks completed**:

If every task in the filtered set has status `completed`, report a summary:
```
All {count} tasks are already completed.

Completed tasks:
- [{id}] {subject} (completed)
- [{id}] {subject} (completed)
...
```
Stop execution.

**No unblocked tasks**:

If there are pending tasks but none have their dependencies satisfied (all blockedBy tasks are not yet completed), report the blocking chains:
```
No unblocked tasks found. All {count} pending tasks are blocked:
- [{id}] {subject} -- blocked by: [{blocker_id1}], [{blocker_id2}]
- [{id}] {subject} -- blocked by: [{blocker_id1}]
...
```
Stop execution.

**Circular dependencies**:

If after topological analysis, some tasks remain unassignable because they form dependency cycles:

1. **Detect**: Identify the set of tasks involved in cycles (tasks that cannot be assigned to any wave because their blockers are also unassigned).
2. **Break at weakest link**: Find the task in the cycle with the fewest `blockedBy` entries. Remove its `blockedBy` relationships for wave assignment purposes (do NOT modify the actual task — this is a planning-time override only).
3. **Warn the user**: Include a warning in the execution plan output (Step 3):
   ```
   WARNING: Circular dependency detected among tasks: [{id1}], [{id2}], [{id3}]
   Breaking cycle at [{weakest_id}] "{subject}" (fewest blockers: {count}).
   This task will be scheduled without waiting for its blockers.
   ```
4. Continue with wave assignment using the broken cycle.

---

## Step 2: Configure & Plan

```
Input:  Filtered task set, .claude/agent-alchemy.local.md (optional)
Output: Execution plan with wave assignments
```

### 2a: Read Settings

Read `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md` if it exists. Parse YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters for settings under the `run-tasks` namespace. If the file is missing or any setting is absent, use the default silently (missing settings file is not an error).

| Setting | Key in YAML | Default | Description |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Max Parallel | `run-tasks.max_parallel` | `5` | Hint to wave-lead for executor pacing |
| Max Retries | `run-tasks.max_retries` | `1` | Autonomous retries per tier before escalation |
| Retry Partial | `run-tasks.retry_partial` | `false` | Whether to retry PARTIAL tasks. When false, PARTIAL tasks are marked completed (not retried). |
| CM Threshold | `run-tasks.context_manager_threshold` | `3` | Minimum task count per wave to spawn a Context Manager. Waves with fewer tasks skip CM. |
| Wave Lead Model | `run-tasks.wave_lead_model` | `opus` | Model tier for wave-lead agents |
| Context Manager Model | `run-tasks.context_manager_model` | `sonnet` | Model tier for context manager agents |
| Executor Model | `run-tasks.executor_model` | `opus` | Model tier for task executor agents |

**Parsing procedure**:

1. Attempt to read `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md`. If the file does not exist, use all defaults and continue silently.
2. Extract YAML frontmatter: find content between the opening `---` and closing `---` delimiters at the top of the file.
3. Parse the extracted YAML. If parsing fails (malformed YAML), log a warning message and use all defaults:
   ```
   Warning: Malformed YAML in .claude/agent-alchemy.local.md — using default settings.
   ```
4. For each setting, look up the key (e.g., `run-tasks.max_parallel`) in the parsed YAML:
   - If the key is present and has a valid value, use it.
   - If the key is missing, use the documented default.
5. **CLI argument precedence**: CLI args override file settings:
   - `--max-parallel` overrides `run-tasks.max_parallel`
   - `--retries` overrides `run-tasks.max_retries`
   - Precedence order: CLI arg > settings file > default value

**Edge cases**:
- **No settings file**: All 5 defaults used silently — not an error.
- **Partial settings** (some keys present, others missing): Use parsed values for present keys, defaults for missing keys.
- **Malformed YAML**: Use all defaults, log warning, continue execution.
- **Empty frontmatter** (just `---\n---`): Treated as no settings — all defaults used.

**Model settings are applied in Step 5** when spawning agents. See the claude-code-teams reference for model tier semantics (Opus for complex reasoning, Sonnet for parallel work).

**Example `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md`**:
```yaml
---
run-tasks.max_parallel: 3
run-tasks.max_retries: 2
run-tasks.wave_lead_model: opus
run-tasks.context_manager_model: sonnet
run-tasks.executor_model: opus
---
```

### 2b: Topological Wave Assignment

**Single-task mode**: If a single task was selected via positional `<task-id>`, skip topological sorting. Create a single wave containing just that task. Proceed to Step 2c.

Build a dependency graph from the filtered task set and assign tasks to waves using topological sorting:

**Algorithm**:

1. Collect all non-completed tasks from the filtered set.
2. For each task, determine its `blockedBy` dependencies. Treat already-completed blockers as satisfied (ignore them).
3. **Wave 1**: All tasks with no unsatisfied `blockedBy` dependencies (empty blockedBy list, or all blockers already completed).
4. **Wave 2**: Tasks whose ALL unsatisfied blockers are assigned to Wave 1.
5. **Wave N**: Tasks whose ALL unsatisfied blockers are assigned to waves 1 through N-1.
6. Continue until all tasks are assigned to a wave, or remaining tasks form circular dependencies (handled in Step 1c).

**Wave capping**: If a wave contains more tasks than `max_parallel`, split into sub-waves of `max_parallel` size, maintaining priority ordering. Sub-waves execute sequentially within the logical wave boundary. For display purposes, sub-waves are shown as `Wave N.1`, `Wave N.2`, etc.

### 2c: Within-Wave Priority Sort

Within each wave (or sub-wave), sort tasks by:

1. **Priority tier** (descending importance):
   - `critical` — first
   - `high` — second
   - `medium` — third
   - `low` — fourth
   - Tasks without `metadata.priority` or with unrecognized values — last

2. **Tie-breaking — "unblocks most others"**: Among tasks with the same priority, sort by the number of other tasks that list this task in their `blockedBy` field (descending). Tasks that unblock more downstream work execute first.

3. **Final tie-breaking — task ID**: If priority and unblock count are equal, lower task ID goes first (stable ordering).

### 2d: Build Execution Plan

Assemble the complete execution plan with:

- Total task count (pending tasks to execute)
- Wave count (number of waves, including sub-waves)
- Per-wave task list with: task ID, subject, priority, dependencies (if any)
- Already-completed task count (for context)
- Blocked task list (tasks that cannot be scheduled due to unresolved external dependencies)
- Settings summary (max_parallel, max_retries, model tiers)
- Any circular dependency warnings from Step 1c

---

## Step 3: Confirm

```
Input:  Execution plan from Step 2
Output: User confirmation, --dry-run exit, or user cancellation
```

### 3a: Display Execution Plan

Present the execution plan to the user. Include all information needed for an informed decision:

```
EXECUTION PLAN
==============
Tasks to execute: {count}
Completed: {completed_count} (already done)
Blocked: {blocked_count} (unresolvable dependencies)

Settings:
  Max parallel: {max_parallel}
  Max retries: {max_retries}
  Wave lead model: {wave_lead_model}
  Context manager model: {context_manager_model}
  Executor model: {executor_model}

{If circular dependency warnings exist:}
WARNINGS:
  {circular dependency warning from Step 1c}

WAVE 1 ({n} tasks, team: 1 wave-lead + 1 context-mgr + {n} executors):
  1. [{id}] {subject} ({priority})
  2. [{id}] {subject} ({priority})
  ...

WAVE 2 ({n} tasks, team: 1 wave-lead + 1 context-mgr + {n} executors):
  3. [{id}] {subject} ({priority}) -- after [{dep_ids}]
  4. [{id}] {subject} ({priority}) -- after [{dep_ids}]
  ...

{Additional waves...}

{If blocked tasks exist:}
BLOCKED (cannot be scheduled):
  [{id}] {subject} -- blocked by: [{blocker_ids}]
  ...
```

### 3b: Handle --dry-run

If `--dry-run` was specified:

1. Display the full execution plan (same format as 3a).
2. Report: `Dry run complete. No tasks were modified and no session was created.`
3. Exit immediately. Do NOT:
   - Call `TaskUpdate` on any task
   - Create any session directory or files
   - Spawn any agents or teams

### 3c: Request User Confirmation

If NOT `--dry-run`, present the plan via `AskUserQuestion` and ask for confirmation:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Confirm Execution"
    question: "Ready to execute {count} tasks in {wave_count} waves?"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, start execution"
        description: "Proceed with the execution plan above. {wave_count} wave teams will be spawned ({wave_lead_model} wave-leads, {context_manager_model} context managers, {executor_model} executors)."
      - label: "Cancel"
        description: "Abort without executing or modifying any tasks"
    multiSelect: false
```

**If the user selects "Cancel"**:
```
Execution cancelled. No tasks were modified.
```
Stop execution. Do not proceed to Step 4 or any subsequent steps.

**If the user selects "Yes, start execution"**:
Proceed to Step 4 (Initialize Session).

---

## Step 4: Initialize Session

```
Input:  Task group name (from --task-group or inferred), timestamp
Output: Session directory with initial files, session ID
```

### 4a: Generate Session ID

Build the session ID from the task group and current timestamp:

- If `--task-group` was provided: `{task-group}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`
- If no `--task-group` but all open tasks share the same `metadata.task_group`: use that group name with the same format
- Otherwise: `exec-session-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`

Store the session ID for use in Step 6 (archive path).

**Examples**:
```
--task-group auth-feature  →  auth-feature-20260223-143022
(all tasks share group "payments")  →  payments-20260223-143022
(mixed groups, no --task-group)  →  exec-session-20260223-143022
```

### 4b: Check for Existing Session

Check whether `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` exists and contains files. Detection is based on directory content presence — there is no `.lock` file in the new engine.

**If `__live_session__/` has content** (interrupted session detected):

Present the user with a choice via `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Interrupted Session Detected"
    question: "An existing session was found in __live_session__/. How would you like to proceed?"
    options:
      - label: "Resume"
        description: "Reset any in_progress tasks to pending and continue from the next unblocked wave."
      - label: "Fresh start"
        description: "Archive the interrupted session and start a new one."
    multiSelect: false
```

**If the user selects "Resume"**:

1. Read the existing `execution_context.md` and `task_log.md` to understand prior progress.
2. Find all tasks with status `in_progress` via `TaskList`.
3. Reset each `in_progress` task to `pending` via `TaskUpdate`.
4. Log the reset:
   ```
   Resumed interrupted session. Reset {count} in_progress task(s) to pending:
   - [{id}] {subject}
   - [{id}] {subject}
   ```
5. Continue to Step 5 (Execute Waves) — the existing session directory and files are reused.

**If the user selects "Fresh start"**:

1. Generate an archive timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (current time).
2. Move all contents of `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` to `.claude/sessions/interrupted-{timestamp}/`.
3. Reset any `in_progress` tasks from the interrupted session to `pending` via `TaskUpdate`.
4. Log the archival:
   ```
   Archived interrupted session to .claude/sessions/interrupted-{timestamp}/.
   Reset {count} in_progress task(s) to pending.
   ```
5. Continue to Step 4c (create fresh session files).

**If `__live_session__/` is empty or does not exist**:

Continue to Step 4c.

### 4c: Clean Up Stale Teams

Before creating session files, scan for orphaned wave team directories from previous sessions that may have crashed before cleanup:

1. Check `~/.claude/teams/` for directories matching the pattern `wave-*`
2. For each matching directory:
   a. Read its `config.json` to enumerate any listed members
   b. Force-stop ALL listed members via `TaskStop` (best-effort — ignore errors for already-terminated agents)
   c. Remove the stale team directory
   d. Log: "Cleaned up stale team directory: {dir_name}"
3. If `~/.claude/teams/` does not exist or contains no `wave-*` directories, skip this step silently

This step mitigates orphaned team directories from wave-leads that crashed before calling `TeamDelete` in a prior session.

### 4d: Create Session Directory

Create `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` (if it does not already exist) and populate it with the initial session files:

**1. `execution_context.md`** — Empty template:

```markdown
# Execution Context
```

This file will be populated by the orchestrator after each wave with learnings from wave-lead summaries.

**2. `task_log.md`** — Header row only:

```markdown
# Task Log

| Task | Subject | Wave | Status | Attempts | Duration | Tokens |
|------|---------|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
```

Updated by the orchestrator after each wave with per-task results from the wave summary.

**3. `execution_plan.md`** — Populated from the Step 2 plan:

```markdown
# Execution Plan

**Task Group**: {task_group or "mixed"}
**Total Tasks**: {count}
**Total Waves**: {wave_count}
**Max Parallel**: {max_parallel}
**Generated**: {ISO 8601 timestamp}

## Wave 1 ({n} tasks)
| Task | Subject | Priority | Complexity |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| #{id} | {subject} | {priority} | {complexity} |
...

## Wave 2 ({n} tasks)
| Task | Subject | Priority | Complexity | Blocked By |
|------|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| #{id} | {subject} | {priority} | {complexity} | #{dep_ids} |
...
```

**4. `progress.jsonl`** — Session start event:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601 timestamp}","event":"session_start","task_group":"{task_group}","total_tasks":{count},"total_waves":{wave_count}}
```

**Progress event writing is best-effort** — failures do not affect execution flow. All event writes throughout the orchestration loop (session_start, wave_start, task_start, task_complete, wave_complete, session_complete) follow this principle: if an append to `progress.jsonl` fails for any reason (permissions, disk full, etc.), log a warning and continue execution normally. Progress events are informational — they must never interrupt the execution pipeline.

**Per-task progress events** (written by the wave-lead, not the orchestrator):

The wave-lead writes `task_start` and `task_complete` events directly to `progress.jsonl` for real-time visibility within a wave:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"task_start","wave":{N},"task_id":"{id}","subject":"{subject}"}
{"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"task_complete","wave":{N},"task_id":"{id}","status":"{PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL}","duration_s":{seconds}}
```

These events appear between the orchestrator's `wave_start` and `wave_complete` events, providing fine-grained progress tracking for dashboards and monitoring tools.

### 4e: Emit Session Start

Report the session initialization:

```
Session initialized: .claude/sessions/__live_session__/
Session ID: {session_id}
Files created: execution_context.md, task_log.md, execution_plan.md, progress.jsonl

Execution plan: {total_tasks} tasks across {total_waves} waves (max {max_parallel} parallel)
```

Proceed to Step 5.

---

## Step 5: Execute Waves

```
Input:  Execution plan, session directory, settings (max_parallel, max_retries, model tiers)
Output: Per-wave results in task_log.md, updated execution_context.md
Loop:   Repeats until no more unblocked tasks remain
```

### 5a: Identify Unblocked Tasks

Before each wave iteration, refresh the task list via `TaskList` to pick up status changes from prior waves. Identify unblocked tasks: tasks whose status is `pending` and whose `blockedBy` dependencies are all `completed`.

**Wave with 0 unblocked tasks after filtering**: If all remaining non-completed tasks are blocked (and no circular dependency can be broken), the wave loop terminates. This can happen if prior wave failures left downstream tasks permanently blocked.

### 5b: Write Wave Start Event

Append a `wave_start` event to `progress.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601 timestamp}","event":"wave_start","wave":{N},"task_count":{count}}
```

Emit a human-readable progress message:

```
Starting Wave {N}/{total_waves}: {count} tasks...
```

### 5c: Launch Wave Lead

Spawn the wave-lead as a plain foreground Task (no `team_name`, no `name`). The wave-lead creates its own team internally via `TeamCreate` in its Step 1b:

```
Task:
  prompt: "<Protocol 1 wave assignment>"
  description: "Lead wave {N} execution"
  subagent_type: "wave-lead"
```

The wave-lead is NOT a teammate — it is the team lead. It creates its own team using the session ID provided in the prompt, then spawns context managers and executors as teammates within that team.

The wave-lead runs to completion, managing all executors, collecting results, cleaning up its team, and writing a summary file before exiting.

Construct the wave-lead prompt using the **Protocol 1: Orchestrator to Wave Lead** format from `communication-protocols.md`:

```
WAVE ASSIGNMENT
Wave: {N} of {total_waves}
Max Parallel: {max_parallel}
Max Retries: {max_retries}
Retry Partial: {retry_partial}
CM Threshold: {context_manager_threshold}
Session ID: {session_id}
Session Dir: {absolute path to .claude/sessions/__live_session__/}
Context Manager Model: {context_manager_model}
Executor Model: {executor_model}

TASKS:
- Task #{id}: {subject}
  Description: {full task description including acceptance criteria}
  Priority: {priority}
  Complexity: {complexity or "not specified"}
  Metadata: {key=value pairs for spec_path, task_group, spec_phase if present}

- Task #{id}: {subject}
  ...

CROSS-WAVE CONTEXT:
{Summary of execution_context.md content from prior waves.
 For Wave 1: omit this section entirely if no prior context exists.
 For Wave 2+: include wave-by-wave learnings, key decisions, and known issues.}

PRODUCER OUTPUTS:
{For each task in this wave that has blockedBy relationships to completed tasks
 whose produces_for metadata includes this task's ID, include a structured entry:}
- Producer: Task #{id} ({subject})
  Files: {comma-separated list of files from task_results mapping}
  Summary: {brief summary from task_results mapping}
{Omit this section entirely if no tasks in this wave have producer dependencies.
 For Wave 1: always omitted (no prior completions).}
```

**Cross-Wave Context Bridge** (bridges knowledge between waves):

The Context Manager handles within-wave context distribution; the orchestrator is responsible for bridging context across waves. Before spawning each wave-lead, the orchestrator constructs the `CROSS-WAVE CONTEXT` section:

1. Read `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/execution_context.md`.
2. **Wave 1 (no prior context)**: If the file contains only the `# Execution Context` header or is empty, omit the `CROSS-WAVE CONTEXT` section entirely from the wave-lead prompt.
3. **Wave 2+ (prior context exists)**: If the file contains content beyond the header (wave sections from prior waves), construct a concise summary:
   - **Per-wave task outcomes**: For each prior wave, list task IDs with their statuses (e.g., `Wave 1: #1 (PASS), #2 (PASS), #3 (FAIL)`).
   - **Accumulated learnings**: Merge the `### Learnings` subsections from all prior waves into a deduplicated bullet list. Prioritize learnings relevant to the current wave's tasks (file patterns, conventions, tech stack details).
   - **Key decisions**: Merge the `### Key Decisions` subsections from all prior waves. Include the task ID that made each decision for traceability.
   - **Known issues**: Merge the `### Issues` subsections from all prior waves. Exclude issues that were subsequently resolved (i.e., a later wave's learnings explicitly note resolution).
   - **Keep the summary concise**: Target 30-60 lines total. If prior waves produced extensive context, summarize aggressively — the Context Manager within the wave will provide full detail to individual executors.
4. Include the summary in the `CROSS-WAVE CONTEXT` section of the wave-lead prompt.

**Example cross-wave context for Wave 3**:

```
CROSS-WAVE CONTEXT:
Wave 1 completed: #1 (PASS), #2 (PASS), #3 (FAIL), #4 (PASS)
Wave 2 completed: #5 (PASS), #6 (PASS)

Learnings:
- Runtime: Node.js 22 with pnpm
- Tests: vitest with `__tests__/{name}.test.ts` pattern
- Middleware pattern: `src/middleware/{name}.ts` with co-located tests
- API routes follow `src/api/{resource}/route.ts` pattern

Key Decisions:
- [Task #1] Used Zod for runtime validation
- [Task #2] Shared types in `src/types/` directory
- [Task #4] Used middleware pattern for auth validation

Issues:
- Vitest mock.calls behavior differs from Jest -- reset between tests
```

### 5d: Wait for Wave Lead and Read Summary

The wave-lead runs as a foreground `Task`, so the orchestrator blocks until it completes. After the Task returns, the orchestrator reads the wave summary from `{session_dir}/wave-{N}-summary.md`.

The wave summary file contains (per **Protocol 2** from `communication-protocols.md`):
- Per-task results (status, duration, summary, files modified)
- Failed task details for escalation (if any)
- Context updates from this wave
- Cleanup results including whether the team was deleted

**Capture wave-level metrics via `TaskOutput`**:

After the wave-lead foreground Task completes, call `TaskOutput` on the wave-lead's task ID to capture aggregate wave metrics (`duration_ms`, `total_tokens` if available). Store these metrics for inclusion in `task_log.md` and `session_summary.md`.

**Caveat**: Whether `TaskOutput` on a foreground Task returns `duration_ms`/`total_tokens` depends on runtime capabilities. If the fields are not present in the `TaskOutput` response, fall back to the wave-lead's self-reported duration from the wave summary. Do not fail if metrics are unavailable — they are informational only. Per-executor token data is not available to the orchestrator; only aggregate wave-level metrics from the wave-lead task are captured.

**Wave-Lead Crash Recovery**:

"Crash" includes: agent timeout, unexpected termination, Task tool returning an error, or the wave summary file (`{session_dir}/wave-{N}-summary.md`) not existing after the Task returns.

**First crash — automatic recovery (no user intervention)**:

1. **Identify affected tasks**: Read `TaskList` to find tasks assigned to this wave. Categorize each:
   - **Completed**: Tasks with status `completed` — these are preserved as-is. The wave-lead called `TaskUpdate` to mark them completed before the crash occurred.
   - **In-progress**: Tasks with status `in_progress` — these need reset.
   - **Pending**: Tasks with status `pending` that were assigned to this wave but never started — these are included in the retry.
2. **Reset in-progress tasks**: For each `in_progress` task, call `TaskUpdate` to set status back to `pending`.
3. **Build retry task list**: Collect all tasks that are now `pending` (reset tasks + tasks that were never started). If all wave tasks were already completed before the crash, skip retry — there is nothing to retry.
4. **Clean up failed team** (aggressive — skip cooperative shutdown in crash scenarios):
   a. Read `~/.claude/teams/{wave-team-name}/config.json` to enumerate all team members (the wave-lead constructs the team name as `wave-{N}-{session_id}`).
   b. Force-stop ALL members via `TaskStop` immediately (in crash scenarios, agents are likely unresponsive — go directly to force-stop without attempting cooperative shutdown).
   c. Wait 3 seconds for terminations to propagate.
   d. **Note**: The orchestrator CANNOT call `TeamDelete` — only the team lead (wave-lead) can delete a team it created. The orphaned team directory will persist but uses a unique name (`wave-{N}-{session_id}`) that won't interfere with the retry team. Log a warning:
      ```jsonl
      {"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"orphaned_team","wave":{N},"team":"{wave-team-name}","reason":"wave-lead crashed before TeamDelete"}
      ```
   e. If config.json cannot be read (team directory already gone or wave-lead crashed before `TeamCreate`): no members to clean up. Proceed directly to retry.
5. **Log the crash**: Append a note to `task_log.md`:
   ```
   | -- | Wave {N} lead crashed | {N} | CRASH | -- | -- |
   ```
   Write a `wave_lead_crash` event to `progress.jsonl`:
   ```jsonl
   {"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"wave_lead_crash","wave":{N},"completed_preserved":{count},"tasks_reset":{count},"retry":true}
   ```
6. **Spawn new wave-lead**: Go back to Step 5c with the retry task list (not the original wave — only unfinished tasks). The new wave-lead will create its own team with a distinct name (`wave-{N}-retry-{session_id}`).

**Second crash — user escalation**:

If the retry wave-lead also crashes (same detection criteria), the orchestrator does NOT retry again automatically. Instead:

1. Reset any `in_progress` tasks to `pending` (same as first crash).
2. Clean up the failed retry team using the same aggressive procedure as the first crash (item 4 above): read config.json, force-stop ALL members via `TaskStop`, wait 3 seconds. Log warning about orphaned team directory.
3. Escalate to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Wave Lead Crash"
    question: "Wave {N} lead agent crashed twice. {count} task(s) are affected.\nCompleted before crash: {completed_list or 'none'}\nUnfinished tasks: {pending_list}"
    options:

      - label: "Abort session"
        description: "Stop execution entirely"
    multiSelect: false
```

Handle the user's choice:

- **Retry wave**: Go back to Step 5c with the pending task list. If this third attempt also crashes, escalate to the user again with the same 3 options (no automatic retry limit on user-initiated retries).
- **Skip wave**: Mark all pending wave tasks as `failed` via `TaskUpdate` with reason "skipped (wave-lead crash)". Log each in `task_log.md`. Continue to Step 5f (verify cleanup) and Step 5g (inter-wave transition). Downstream tasks that depend on skipped tasks will remain blocked — the orchestrator will detect this in 5g and report stalled execution if no other unblocked tasks exist.
- **Abort session**: Proceed directly to Step 6 (Summarize & Archive) with partial results.

**Wave-lead fails to create its team (TeamCreate failure)**:

If the wave-lead exits immediately because it failed to create its team (Step 1b failure):

1. The wave-lead writes an error summary to `{session_dir}/wave-{N}-summary.md` before exiting.
2. The orchestrator reads this error summary and treats it as a crash.
3. No team was created, so no cleanup is needed (no config.json, no members to stop).
4. Escalate to the user via `AskUserQuestion` with the same 3 options as the second crash (Retry wave / Skip wave / Abort session).

### 5e: Process Wave Summary

After reading the wave summary file from `{session_dir}/wave-{N}-summary.md`:

**Staleness check**: Before updating task status based on wave results, read the current state via `TaskGet` for each task to verify it hasn't been modified by hooks, other processes, or prior wave recovery. This prevents overwriting status changes made by `TaskCompleted` hooks.

**1. Update `task_log.md`**:

Read the current `task_log.md`, then append a row for each task in the wave summary:

```markdown
| #{id} | {subject} | {wave_number} | {status} | {attempts} | {duration} | {tokens or "--"} |
```

The Tokens column shows per-task token usage if reported by the wave-lead, or `--` if unavailable.

Write the complete updated file (read-modify-write pattern).

**2. Write `task_complete` events to `progress.jsonl`**:

For each task in the wave summary, append a `task_complete` event:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601 timestamp}","event":"task_complete","wave":{N},"task_id":"{id}","status":"{PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL}","duration_s":{seconds}}
```

Write one event per task, in the order they appear in the wave summary. Best-effort — if a write fails, log a warning and continue processing the remaining tasks.

**3. Write `wave_complete` event to `progress.jsonl`**:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601 timestamp}","event":"wave_complete","wave":{N},"tasks_passed":{count},"tasks_partial":{count},"tasks_failed":{count},"duration_s":{seconds}}
```

**4. Update `execution_context.md`**:

If the wave summary includes a `CONTEXT UPDATES` section, append a new wave section to `execution_context.md`:

```markdown
---

## Wave {N}
**Completed**: {ISO 8601 timestamp}
**Tasks**: #{id1} ({status}), #{id2} ({status}), ...

### Learnings
{learnings from the wave summary CONTEXT UPDATES}

### Key Decisions
{decisions from the wave summary, if any}

### Issues
{issues from the wave summary, if any — or "None"}
```

Write the complete updated file (read-modify-write pattern).

**5. Store per-task result summaries for producer-consumer handoff**:

For each task in the wave summary, store a result record in a persistent mapping (maintained across waves by the orchestrator). This mapping enables the producer-consumer handoff in Step 5d:

```
task_results[task_id] = {
  subject: "{task subject}",
  status: "{PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL}",
  files: "{comma-separated list of modified files from wave summary}",
  summary: "{brief summary from wave summary}"
}
```

This mapping is used in Step 5d when constructing the wave-lead prompt for subsequent waves: if a Wave N task has `blockedBy` relationships to completed tasks whose `produces_for` metadata includes the current task's ID, the orchestrator injects a `PRODUCER OUTPUTS` section with the producer's result details.

**6. Emit wave completion summary**:

```
Wave {N}/{total_waves} complete: {passed} passed, {failed} failed ({duration})
  - #{id} {subject}: {status} ({duration})
  - #{id} {subject}: {status} ({duration})
  ...
```

**7. Handle Tier 3 escalations**:

If the wave summary includes a `FAILED TASKS (for escalation)` section, these are tasks that exhausted Tier 1 and Tier 2 retries within the wave-lead. The orchestrator must present each failed task to the user individually.

**Multiple failed tasks**: If the wave has multiple failed tasks, escalate each one sequentially via separate `AskUserQuestion` calls. Process them in task ID order (lowest first). The user's decision on one task does not affect the options for other tasks — except "Abort session", which immediately terminates and skips remaining escalations.

For each escalated task, use `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Task Failed After Retries"
    question: "Task #{id} '{subject}' failed after {attempts} attempts.\n\nFailure reason: {failure_reason}\nTier 1 retry: {tier1_outcome}\nTier 2 retry: {tier2_outcome}\n\n{If task has downstream dependents:}\nNote: {count} downstream task(s) depend on this task: [{dependent_ids}]"
    options:
      - label: "Fix manually and continue"
        description: "I'll fix the issue myself. Mark the task as completed (manual) after I confirm."
      - label: "Skip this task"
        description: "Skip this task and continue with remaining execution."
      - label: "Provide guidance"
        description: "I'll provide instructions for a guided retry."
      - label: "Abort session"
        description: "Stop execution entirely."
    multiSelect: false
```

Handle the user's choice:

**Option 1: Fix manually and continue**

1. Present a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the fix:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Manual Fix Confirmation"
    question: "Task #{id} '{subject}' -- confirm when your manual fix is complete."
    options:
      - label: "Fix is done"
        description: "Mark the task as completed and continue execution."
      - label: "Cancel"
        description: "Go back to the escalation options for this task."
    multiSelect: false
```

2. If the user selects "Fix is done": mark the task as `completed` via `TaskUpdate`. Log in `task_log.md` as status `PASS (manual)`. Continue to the next escalated task (or proceed to 5f if no more escalations).
3. If the user selects "Cancel": re-present the original 4-option escalation for this task.

**Option 2: Skip this task**

1. Mark the task as `failed` via `TaskUpdate` (it remains in failed status).
2. Log in `task_log.md` as status `SKIPPED (user)`.
3. **Warn about dependent tasks**: Check the full task list for tasks whose `blockedBy` includes the skipped task ID. If any exist, warn the user:
   ```
   Skipped task #{id}. The following downstream tasks are now blocked and cannot execute:
   - [{dep_id}] {dep_subject}
   - [{dep_id}] {dep_subject}
   These tasks will remain pending unless their other dependencies are met through alternative means.
   ```
   This is informational only — do not ask for additional confirmation. Continue to the next escalated task.
4. Continue execution with remaining waves. Downstream tasks that exclusively depend on the skipped task will remain blocked and will be reported as stalled in Step 5g.

**Option 3: Provide guidance**

1. Prompt the user for guidance text via `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Provide Guidance for Task #{id}"
    question: "Enter your guidance for retrying task #{id} '{subject}'.\n\nOriginal failure: {failure_reason}\nInclude any specific instructions, hints, or approaches the executor should try."
    options:
      - label: "Submit guidance"
        description: "Launch a guided retry with the instructions above."
    freeformLabel: "Guidance"
    multiSelect: false
```

2. Spawn a new single-task executor agent (not through the wave-lead, since the wave has already completed) with an enriched prompt containing:
   - The original task description and acceptance criteria
   - The failure context from the original attempt (failure reason, tier outcomes)
   - The user's guidance text
   - The current `execution_context.md` content (for project context)

   Use a fresh `Task` call (foreground, not background) to run the guided executor. The executor follows the standard 4-phase workflow (Understand, Implement, Verify, Report).

3. **If the guided retry succeeds** (executor reports PASS): Mark the task as `completed` via `TaskUpdate`. Log in `task_log.md` as status `PASS (guided)`. Continue to the next escalated task.

4. **If the guided retry fails** (executor reports FAIL or PARTIAL): Re-prompt the user with the same 4-option escalation, but include the guided retry outcome in the question:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Guided Retry Also Failed"
    question: "Task #{id} '{subject}' failed again after guided retry.\n\nOriginal failure: {original_failure_reason}\nGuided retry failure: {guided_failure_reason}\nYour guidance was: {user_guidance_summary}"
    options:
      - label: "Fix manually and continue"
        description: "I'll fix the issue myself."
      - label: "Skip this task"
        description: "Skip this task and continue."
      - label: "Provide guidance"
        description: "I'll provide new instructions for another retry."
      - label: "Abort session"
        description: "Stop execution entirely."
    multiSelect: false
```

   This creates a loop: the user can keep providing guidance (each attempt spawns a new executor), switch to manual fix, skip, or abort at any point. There is no automatic limit on guided retry attempts — the user controls when to stop.

**Option 4: Abort session**

1. If there are remaining escalated tasks in the queue (multiple failures in this wave), skip them — do not present further escalation prompts.
2. Mark all remaining non-completed tasks as `failed` via `TaskUpdate` with reason "session aborted by user".
3. Log each as `ABORTED` in `task_log.md`.
4. Proceed directly to Step 6 (Summarize & Archive) with partial results. Do not execute any remaining waves.

**Abort during crash recovery**: If the user selects "Abort session" during a crash recovery escalation (from Step 5d), the same abort procedure applies: mark remaining tasks as failed, proceed to Step 6.

### 5f: Verify Wave Cleanup

After processing the wave summary (Step 5e), verify that the wave-lead's cleanup succeeded. The wave-lead is responsible for shutting down sub-agents and calling `TeamDelete` (as the team lead). The orchestrator verifies and handles any failures.

#### 5f-1: Check Wave Summary Cleanup Status

Read the CLEANUP section from the wave summary file:
- If `Team deleted: yes` → the wave-lead handled cleanup. Proceed to verification.
- If `Team deleted: no` → the wave-lead failed to delete its team. Survivors may still be running.
- If the summary file is missing → wave-lead crashed. See crash recovery in Step 5d.

#### 5f-2: Verify Team Directory Removed

Check whether `~/.claude/teams/{wave-team-name}/` directory still exists (the wave-lead constructs the team name as `wave-{N}-{session_id}`):

1. **Team directory is gone**: Cleanup succeeded. Proceed to 5f-3.
2. **Team directory still exists**: The wave-lead failed to delete it (or crashed before `TeamDelete`).
   a. Read `config.json` to enumerate remaining team members.
   b. Force-stop ALL listed members via `TaskStop` (best-effort — agents may already be terminated).
   c. Wait 3 seconds for terminations to propagate.
   d. Log warning: "Orphaned team directory `{wave-team-name}` — wave-lead failed to delete. Members force-stopped."
   e. **Note**: The orchestrator CANNOT call `TeamDelete` because it is not the team lead. The orphaned directory will persist until cleaned up in Step 4c of a future session.
   f. Proceed despite the orphaned directory — each wave uses a unique team name, so it won't interfere.

**Handling config.json read failure:**
- If the config file cannot be read (corrupted or directory exists but config is missing), skip member enumeration and proceed. Log the anomaly.

#### 5f-3: Log Cleanup Results

Write a `wave_cleanup` event to `progress.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"wave_cleanup","wave":{N},"team_deleted_by_lead":{true|false},"orphaned_team":{true|false},"survivors_force_stopped":{count}}
```

### 5g: Inter-Wave Transition

Before checking for remaining work, check for an abort signal and verify readiness for the next wave:

**0. Check for abort signal**: Check whether `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/.abort` exists.

If the `.abort` file exists:
1. Read its content (optional abort reason from the user).
2. Mark all remaining pending tasks as `failed` via `TaskUpdate` with reason "session aborted by user" (or the abort reason if provided).
3. Log: `Abort signal detected. Reason: {reason or "user requested abort"}. Marking {count} remaining task(s) as failed.`
4. Write an `abort_detected` event to `progress.jsonl`:
   ```jsonl
   {"ts":"{ISO 8601}","event":"abort_detected","reason":"{reason}","tasks_aborted":{count}}
   ```
5. Include the `.abort` file in the session archive.
6. Proceed directly to Step 6 (Summarize & Archive) — do not start any more waves.

1. **Brief cooldown**: Wait 2 seconds between waves. This ensures any asynchronous cleanup (inbox file deletion, process termination) has time to complete before the next wave.

2. **Check for remaining work**:
   a. Refresh the task list via `TaskList`.
   b. Identify newly unblocked tasks (tasks that were blocked by wave tasks that just completed).
   c. If unblocked tasks exist: return to Step 5a for the next wave.
   d. If no unblocked tasks remain:
      - If all non-completed tasks are blocked (dependencies not met): log that execution is stalled due to failed dependencies and exit the loop.
      - If all tasks are completed: exit the loop normally.

Proceed to Step 6.

## Step 6: Summarize & Archive

```
Input:  task_log.md, execution_context.md, progress.jsonl
Output: session_summary.md, archived session directory
```

### 6a: Generate Session Summary

Read `task_log.md` and `execution_context.md` to build a comprehensive session report. Write `session_summary.md` to `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/`:

```markdown
# Session Summary

**Session ID**: {session_id}
**Task Group**: {task_group or "mixed"}
**Started**: {ISO 8601 timestamp from session_start event}
**Completed**: {ISO 8601 timestamp now}
**Total Duration**: {human-readable duration}
**Total Tokens**: {aggregate total_tokens from TaskOutput across all waves, or "unavailable" if not captured}

## Results

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tasks | {total} |
| Passed | {pass_count} |
| Failed | {fail_count} |
| Partial | {partial_count} |
| Skipped | {skipped_count} |

## Per-Wave Breakdown

### Wave 1
- Duration: {duration}
- Tasks: {passed} passed, {failed} failed
- #{id} {subject}: {status} ({duration})
- #{id} {subject}: {status} ({duration})

### Wave 2
- Duration: {duration}
- Tasks: {passed} passed, {failed} failed
- #{id} {subject}: {status} ({duration})

{Additional waves...}

## Failed Tasks

{If no failures: "None -- all tasks passed."}

{If failures exist:}
| Task | Subject | Wave | Reason |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| #{id} | {subject} | {wave} | {failure reason} |

## Key Decisions

{Extracted from execution_context.md Key Decisions sections across all waves.
 If none: "No significant decisions recorded."}

## Learnings

{Extracted from execution_context.md Learnings sections across all waves.
 If none: "No significant learnings recorded."}
```

### 6b: Write Session Complete Event

Append the final event to `progress.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"ts":"{ISO 8601 timestamp}","event":"session_complete","total_passed":{pass_count},"total_failed":{fail_count},"total_partial":{partial_count},"total_duration_s":{seconds},"total_tokens":{tokens_or_null}}
```

### 6c: Display Summary

Present the session results to the user:

```
SESSION COMPLETE
================
Session: {session_id}
Duration: {total_duration}
Results: {pass_count} passed, {fail_count} failed, {partial_count} partial, {skipped_count} skipped

{If failures:}
Failed tasks:
- [{id}] {subject}: {reason}
```

### 6d: Archive Session

Move the completed session from the live directory to its permanent archive:

1. Create the archive directory: `.claude/sessions/{session-id}/`
2. Move all files from `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` to `.claude/sessions/{session-id}/`.
3. Leave `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` as an empty directory (ready for the next session).

**Archive race condition**: If `.claude/sessions/{session-id}/` already exists (extremely unlikely — would require two sessions with the same timestamp), append a counter: `{session-id}-2`, `{session-id}-3`, etc.

---

## Step 7: Finalize

```
Input:  execution_context.md (from archived session), CLAUDE.md
Output: CLAUDE.md edits (if warranted)
```

### 7a: Review Execution Context

Read the archived `execution_context.md` from `.claude/sessions/{session-id}/execution_context.md` and evaluate whether any learnings represent **project-wide changes** that should be reflected in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Changes that warrant CLAUDE.md updates**:
- New dependencies added to the project (e.g., new libraries installed)
- New patterns established that other developers or agents should follow
- Architecture decisions that affect the project structure
- New commands or build steps discovered
- New configuration requirements
- Structural changes to the repository (new directories, renamed files)

**Changes that do NOT warrant CLAUDE.md updates**:
- Task-specific implementation details
- Internal agent learnings (file locations for a specific feature)
- Workarounds for one-time issues
- Test-specific patterns that are obvious from the test files themselves

### 7b: Update CLAUDE.md

If meaningful changes were identified:

1. Read the current `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Identify the appropriate sections to update (e.g., Development Commands, Architecture Patterns, Conventions).
3. Make targeted edits — add or modify only the specific entries that changed.
4. Do not rewrite unrelated sections.

Report what was updated:
```
Updated CLAUDE.md:
- Added {description of change}
- Updated {description of change}
```

If no meaningful changes were identified:
```
No CLAUDE.md updates needed. All learnings were task-specific.
```

### 7c: Final Report

Report that execution is fully complete:

```
Execution complete. Session archived to .claude/sessions/{session-id}/.
```
